  abstract = {Previous observational studies in the stable boundary layer diverge appreciably on the values of dimensionless ratios between turbulence-related quantities and on their stability dependence. In the present study, the hypothesis that such variability is caused by the influence of locally dependent nonturbulent processes, referred to as submeso, is tested and confirmed. This is done using six datasets collected at sites with different surface coverage. The time-scale dependence of wind components and temperature fluctuations is presented using the multiresolution decomposition, which allows the identification of the turbulence and submeso contributions to spectra and cospectra. In the submeso range, the spectra of turbulence kinetic energy range increases exponentially with time scale. The exponent decreases with the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations at a similar manner at all sites. This fact is used to determine the smaller time scale with relevant influence of submeso processes and a ratio that quantifies the relative importance of such nonturbulent processes with respect to turbulence. Based on that, values for the local stability parameter that are unaffected by nonturbulent processes are found. It is shown that the dimensionless ratios do not usually converge to a given value as the time scale increases and that it is as a consequence of the locally dependent submeso influence. The ratios and their stability dependence are determined at the time scales with least influence of nonturbulent processes, but significant site-to-site variability persists. Combining all datasets, expressions for the dependence of the dimensionless ratios on the local stability parameter that minimize the role of the submeso contribution are proposed.},

  abstract = {A climatology of nocturnal low-level jets (LLJs) is presented for the topographically flat measurement site at Cabauw, the Netherlands. LLJ characteristics are derived from a 7-yr half-hourly database of wind speed profiles, obtained from the 200-m mast and a wind profiler. Many LLJs at Cabauw originate from an inertial oscillation, which develops after sunset in a layer decoupled from the surface by stable stratification. The data are classified to different types of stable boundary layers by using the geostrophic wind speed and the isothermal net radiative cooling as classification parameters. For each of these classes, LLJ characteristics like frequency of occurrence, height above ground level, and the turning of the wind vector across the boundary layer are determined. It is found that LLJs occur in about 20\% of the nights, are typically situated at 140\textendash 260 m above ground level, and have a speed of 6\textendash 10 m s21. Development of a substantial LLJ is most likely to occur for moderate geostrophic forcing and a high radiative cooling. A comparison with the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) is added to illustrate how the results can be used to evaluate the performance of atmospheric models.},

  abstract = {While contemporary numerical weather prediction models represent the large-scale structure of moist atmospheric processes reasonably well, they often struggle to maintain accurate forecasts of small-scale features such as convective rainfall. Even though high-resolution models resolve more of the flow, and are therefore arguably more accurate, moist convective flow becomes increasingly nonlinear and dynamically unstable. Importantly, the models' initial conditions are typically sub-optimal, leaving scope to improve the accuracy of forecasts with improved data assimilation. To address issues regarding the use of atmospheric water-related observations \textendash{} especially at convective scales (also known as storm scales) \textendash{} this article discusses the observation and assimilation of water-related quantities. Special emphasis is placed on background error statistics for variational and hybrid methods which need special attention for water variables. The challenges of convective-scale data assimilation of atmospheric water information are discussed, which are more difficult to tackle than at larger scales. Some of the most important challenges include the greater degree of inhomogeneity and lower degree of smoothness of the flow, the high volume of water-related observations (e.g. from radar, microwave and infrared instruments), the need to analyse a range of hydrometeors, the increasing importance of position errors in forecasts, the greater sophistication of forward models to allow use of indirect observations (e.g. cloud- and precipitation-affected observations), the need to account for the flow-dependent multivariate ``balance'' between atmospheric water and both dynamical and mass fields, and the inherent non-Gaussian nature of atmospheric water variables.},

  abstract = {In the nighttime stable boundary layer (SBL), shear and turbulence are generated in the layer between the maximum of the low-level jet (LLJ) and the earth's surface. Here, it is investigated whether gross properties of the LLJ\textemdash its height and speed\textemdash could be used to diagnose turbulence intensities in this subjet layer. Data on the height and speed of the LLJ maximum were available at high vertical and temporal resolution using the high-resolution Doppler lidar (HRDL). These data were used to estimate a subjet layer shear, which was computed as the ratio of the speed to the height of the jet maximum, and a jet Richardson number RiJ, averaged at 15min intervals for 10 nights when HRDL LLJ data were available for this study. The shear and RiJ values were compared with turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) values measured near the top of the 60-m tower at the Cooperative Atmosphere\textendash Surface Exchange Study-1999 (CASES-99) main site. TKE values were small for RiJ greater than 0.4, but as RiJ decreased to less than ϳ0.4, TKE values increased, indicating that RiJ does have merit in estimating turbulence magnitudes. Another interesting finding was that shear values tended to cluster around a constant value of 0.1 sϪ1 for TKE values that were not too small, that is, for TKE greater than ϳ0.1 m2 sϪ2.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Using NOAA's Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system and NCAR's Advanced Research WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) (ARW-WRF) regional model, six experiments are designed by (1) a control experiment (CTRL) and five data assimilation (DA) experiments with different data sets, including (2) conventional data only (CON); (3) microwave data (AMSU-A + MHS) only (MW); (4) infrared data (IASI) only (IR); (5) a combination of microwave and infrared data (MWIR); and (6) a combination of conventional, microwave and infrared observation data (ALL). One-month experiments in July 2012 and the impacts of the DA on temperature and moisture forecasts at the surface and four vertical layers over the western United States have been investigated. The four layers include lower troposphere (LT) from 800 to 1000 hPa, middle troposphere (MT) from 400 to 800 hPa, upper troposphere (UT) from 200 to 400 hPa, and lower stratosphere (LS) from 50 to 200 hPa. The results show that the regional GSI\textendash WRF system is underestimating the observed temperature in the LT and overestimating in the UT and LS. The MW DA reduced the forecast bias from the MT to the LS within 30 h forecasts, and the CON DA kept a smaller forecast bias in the LT for 2-day forecasts. The largest root mean square error (RMSE) is observed in the LT and at the surface (SFC). Compared to the CTRL, the MW DA produced the most positive contribution in the UT and LS, and the CON DA mainly improved the temperature forecasts at the SFC. However, the IR DA gave a negative contribution in the LT. Most of the observed humidity in the different vertical layers is overestimated in the humidity forecasts except in the UT. The smallest bias in the humidity forecast occurred at the SFC and in the UT. The DA experiments apparently reduced the bias from the LT to UT, especially for the IR DA experiment, but the RMSEs are not reduced in the humidity forecasts. Compared to the CTRL, the IR DA experiment has a larger RMSE in the moisture forecast, although the smallest bias is found in the LT and MT.},

  abstract = {To ameliorate suboptimality in ensemble data assimilation, methods have been introduced that involve expanding the ensemble size. Such expansions can incorporate model space covariance localization and/or estimates of climatological or model error covariances. Model space covariance localization in the vertical overcomes problematic aspects of ensemble-based satellite data assimilation. In the case of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), the expanded ensemble size associated with vertical covariance localization would also enable the simultaneous update of entire vertical columns of model variables from hyperspectral and multispectral satellite sounders. However, if the original formulation of the ETKF were applied to an expanded ensemble, it would produce an analysis ensemble that was the same size as the expanded forecast ensemble. This article describes a variation on the ETKF called the gain ETKF (GETKF) that takes advantage of covariances from the expanded ensemble, while producing an analysis ensemble that has the required size of the unexpanded forecast ensemble. The approach also yields an inflation factor that depends on the localization length scale that causes the GETKF to perform differently to an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) using the same expanded ensemble. Experimentation described herein shows that the GETKF outperforms a range of alternative ETKF-based solutions to the aforementioned problems. In cycling data assimilation experiments with a newly developed storm-track version of the Lorenz-96 model, the GETKF analysis root-mean-square error (RMSE) matches the EnSRF RMSE at shorter than optimal localization length scales but is superior in that it yields smaller RMSEs for longer localization length scales.},

The present study focuses on the nowcasting range (1-5 hours) for five severe convective storms in their developing stage that occurred during the warm season in the years 2012-2013. Radar reflectivity and extrapolated radar reflectivity data were assimilated for at least six hours depending on the time of occurrence of convection. Synthetic satellite imageries were calculated using radiative transfer model RTTOV v10.2, which was implemented into the COSMO model. NWP model simulations of IR10.8 {$\mu$}m and WV06.2 {$\mu$}m brightness temperatures (BTs) with a horizontal resolution of 2.8 km were interpolated into the satellite projection and objectively verified against observations using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CORR) and Fractions Skill Score (FSS) values. Naturally, the extrapolation of cloud fields yielded an approximately 25 \% lower RMSE, 20 \% higher CORR and 15 \% higher FSS at the beginning of the second forecasted hour compared to the NWP model forecasts. On the other hand, comparable scores were observed for the third hour, whereas the NWP forecasts outperformed the extrapolation by 10 \% for RMSE, 15 \% for CORR and up to 15 \% for FSS during the fourth forecasted hour and 15 \% for RMSE, 27 \% for CORR and up to 15 \% for FSS during the fifth forecasted hour. The analysis was completed by a verification of the precipitation forecasts yielding approximately 8 \% higher RMSE, 15 \% higher CORR and up to 45 \% higher FSS when the NWP model simulation is used compared to the extrapolation for the first hour. Both the methods yielded unsatisfactory level of precipitation forecast accuracy from the fourth forecasted hour onward.},

  abstract = {This paper uses three methods to estimate and examine observation errors and their correlations for clearsky sounder radiances used in the ECMWF assimilation system. The study considers sounder-radiances from the main instruments currently in use, ie., AMSU-A, HIRS, MHS, AIRS, and IASI. The analysis is based on covariances derived from pairs of First Guess and analysis departures. The methods used are the so-called Hollingsworth/Lonnberg method, a method based on subtracting a scaled version of mapped assumed background errors from FG-departure covariances, and the Desroziers diagnostic. The findings suggest that mid-tropospheric to stratospheric temperature sounding channels for AIRS and IASI and all AMSU-A sounding channels show little or no inter-channel or spatial observation error correlations, and estimates for the observation error are close to the instrument noise. Channels with stronger sensitivity to the surface show larger observation errors compared to the instrument noise, and some of this error is correlated spatially and between channels. Short-wave infrared temperature sounding channels also appear more prone to spatial observation error correlations. The three methods show good consistency for these estimates. Estimating observation errors for humidity sounding channels appears more difficult. A considerable proportion of the observation error for humidity sounding channels appears correlated spatially for short separation distances, as well as between channels. Observation error estimates for humidity channels are generally considerably larger than those provided by the instrument noise. Our statistics suggest that assumed background errors for tropospheric temperature are inflated (by about 30-60\%), whereas there is little indication for background error inflation for stratospheric temperatures.},

  abstract = {A verification system has been developed for the ensemble prediction system (EPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC). This provides objective criteria for comparing two EPSs, necessary when deciding whether or not to implement a new or revised EPS. The proposed verification methodology is based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which provides an evaluation of the global skill of an EPS. Its reliability/resolution partition, proposed by Hersbach, is used to measure the two main attributes of a probabilistic system. Also, the characteristics of the reliability are obtained from the two first moments of the reduced centered random variable (RCRV), which define the bias and the dispersion of an EPS. Resampling bootstrap techniques have been applied to these scores. Confidence intervals are thus defined, expressing the uncertainty due to the finiteness of the number of realizations used to compute the scores. All verifications are performed against observations to provide more independent validations and to avoid any local systematic bias of an analysis. A revised EPS, which has been tested at the CMC in a parallel run during the autumn of 2005, is described in this paper. This EPS has been compared with the previously operational one with the verification system presented above. To illustrate the verification methodology, results are shown for the temperature at 850 hPa. The confidence intervals are computed by taking into account the spatial correlation of the data and the temporal autocorrelation of the forecast error. The revised EPS performs significantly better for all the forecast ranges, except for the resolution component of the CRPS where the improvement is no longer significant from day 7. The significant improvement of the reliability is mainly due to a better dispersion of the ensemble. Finally, the verification system correctly indicates that variations are not significant when two theoretically similar EPSs are compared.},

  abstract = {High-impact weather events over sparse data regions with complex orography, such as the Mediterranean region, remain a challenge for numerical weather prediction. This study evaluates, for the first time, the ability of a multiscale ensemble-based data assimilation system to reproduce a heavy precipitation episode that occurred during the first Special Observation Period (SOP1) of the Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX). During the Intense Observation Period (IOP13) from 14 to 15 October 2012, convective maritime activity associated with an advancing cold front affected coastal areas of southern France, Corsica and Italy. With the main objective of improving forecasts of this weather event, a data assimilation (DA) system using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm is implemented. The potential impact of assimilating conventional insitu observations (METAR, aircrafts, buoys and rawinsondes) and single-Doppler reflectivity data to improve numerical representation of growing convective maritime structures that will evolve towards coastal populated areas is evaluated. Results indicate that information provided by both observation sources contribute to initiation and subsequent evolution of convective structures not captured by the conventional runs. Notably, data assimilation experiments produce the best quantitative verification scores for the short range (6\textendash 8 h) forecasts of accumulated precipitation. Beyond 6\textendash 8 h, data assimilation experiments and those without data assimilation are indistinguishable. Sensitivity experiments, evaluating the impact of increasing the length of the radar data assimilation period, reveal the importance of assimilating high-frequency reflectivity data during a mid-term period (6 h approx.) to better depict deep convective structures initiated over the sea that evolve towards populated coastal areas.},

Doppler velocity measurements from insects occupying the lowest 2 km of the boundary layer during summer months are used to map the vertical velocity component in the CBL. The observations cover four summer periods (2004\textendash 08) and are classified into cloudy and clear boundary layer conditions. Profiles of vertical velocity variance, skewness, and mass flux are estimated to study the daytime evolution of the convective boundary layer during these conditions. A conditional sampling method is applied to the original Doppler velocity dataset to extract coherent vertical velocity structures and to examine plume dimension and contribution to the turbulent transport. Overall, the derived turbulent statistics are consistent with previous aircraft and lidar observations. The observations provide unique insight into the daytime evolution of the convective boundary layer and the role of increased cloudiness in the turbulent budget of the subcloud layer. Coherent structures (plumes\textendash thermals) are found to be responsible for more than 80\% of the total turbulent transport resolved by the cloud radar system. The extended dataset is suitable for evaluating boundary layer parameterizations and testing large-eddy simulations (LESs) for a variety of surface and cloud conditions.},

This high-resolution EnKF (HREnKF) system employs ensemble land analyses and perturbed roughness length to prevent an ensemble spread that is too small near the surface. The HREnKF then performs continuously for a four-day period, from which twelve-hour ensemble forecasts are launched every six hours. The impact on analyses and short-term forecasts of assimilating METAR data is given special attention.It is shown that using ensemble land surface analyses increases near-surface ensemble spreads for temperature and specific humidity. Perturbing roughness length enlarges the spread for surface wind. Given sufficient ensemble spread, the four-day case study shows that the near-surface model state is brought closer to surface observations during the cycling process. The impact of assimilating surface data can also be seen at higher levels by using aircraft reports for verification. The ensemble forecast verification suggests that METAR data assimilation improves ensemble forecasts of air temperature and dewpoint near the surface up to a lead time of six hours or even longer. However, only minor improvement is found in surface wind forecasts.},

Smaller differences occurred in the cloud fields when using different PBL schemes, with the greatest spread in the ensemble statistics occurring during and after daily peak heating hours. Results varied somewhat depending upon the verification method employed, which indicates the importance of using a suite of verification tools when evaluating high-resolution model performance.

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is deploying sensitive, millimeter-wave cloud radars at its Cloud and Radiation Test Bed (CART) sites in Oklahoma, Alaska, and the tropical western Pacific Ocean. The radars complement optical devices, including a Belfort or Vaisala laser ceilometer and a micropulse lidar, in providing a comprehensive source of information on the vertical distribution of hydrometeors overhead at the sites. An algorithm is described that combines data from these active remote sensors to produce an objective determination of hydrometeor height distributions and estimates of their radar reflectivities, vertical velocities, and Doppler spectral widths, which are optimized for accuracy. These data provide fundamental information for retrieving cloud microphysical properties and assessing the radiative effects of clouds on climate. The algorithm is applied to nine months of data from the CART site in Oklahoma for initial evaluation. Much of the algorithm's calculations deal with merging and optimizing data from the radar's four sequential operating modes, which have differing advantages and limitations, including problems resulting from range sidelobes, range aliasing, and coherent averaging. Two of the modes use advanced phase-coded pulse compression techniques to yield approximately 10 and 15 dB more sensitivity than is available from the two conventional pulse modes. Comparison of cloud-base heights from the Belfort ceilometer and the micropulse lidar confirms small biases found in earlier studies, but recent information about the ceilometer brings the agreement to within 20\textendash 30 m. Merged data of the radar's modes were found to miss approximately 5.9\% of the clouds detected by the laser systems. Using data from only the radar's two less-sensitive conventional pulse modes would increase the missed detections to 22\%\textendash 34\%. A significant remaining problem is that the radar's lower-altitude data are often contaminated with echoes from nonhydrometeor targets, such as insects.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates forecasts of thermodynamic variables from five convection-allowing configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) with the Advanced Research core (WRF-ARW). The forecasts vary only in their planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme, including three ``local'' schemes [Mellor\textendash Yamada\textendash Janji c (MYJ), quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE), and Mellor\textendash Yamada\textendash Nakanishi\textendash Niino (MYNN)] and two schemes that include ``nonlocal'' mixing [the asymmetric cloud model version 2 (ACM2) and the Yonei University (YSU) scheme]. The forecasts are compared to springtime radiosonde observations upstream from deep convection to gain a better understanding of the thermodynamic characteristics of these PBL schemes in this regime. The morning PBLs are all too cool and dry despite having little bias in PBL depth (except for YSU). In the evening, the local schemes produce shallower PBLs that are often too shallow and too moist compared to nonlocal schemes. However, MYNN is nearly unbiased in PBL depth, moisture, and potential temperature, which is comparable to the background North American Mesoscale model (NAM) forecasts. This result gives confidence in the use of the MYNN scheme in convection-allowing configurations of WRF-ARW to alleviate the typical cool, moist bias of the MYJ scheme in convective boundary layers upstream from convection. The morning cool and dry biases lead to an underprediction of mixed-layer CAPE (MLCAPE) and an overprediction of mixed-layer convective inhibition (MLCIN) at that time in all schemes. MLCAPE and MLCIN forecasts improve in the evening, with MYJ, QNSE, and MYNN having small mean errors, but ACM2 and YSU having a somewhat low bias. Strong observed capping inversions tend to be associated with an underprediction of MLCIN in the evening, as the model profiles are too smooth. MLCAPE tends to be overpredicted (underpredicted) by MYJ and QNSE (MYNN, ACM2, and YSU) when the observed MLCAPE is relatively small (large).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) is an essential instrument for numerical weather prediction (NWP). It measures radiances at the top of the atmosphere using 8461 channels. The huge amount of observations provided by IASI has led the community to develop techniques to reduce observations while conserving as much information as possible. Thus, a selection of the 300 most informative channels was made for NWP based on the concept of information theory. One of the main limitations of this method was to neglect the covariances between the observation errors of the different channels. However, many centres have shown a significant benefit for weather forecasting to use them. Currently, the observation-error covariances are only estimated on the current IASI channel selection, but no studies to make a new selection of IASI channels taking into account the observation-error covariances have yet been carried out.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The objective of this paper was therefore to perform a new selection of IASI channels by taking into account the observation-error covariances. The results show that with an equivalent number of channels, accounting for the observation-error covariances, a new selection of IASI channels can reduce the analysis error on average in temperature by 3\&thinsp;\%, humidity by 1.8\&thinsp;\% and ozone by 0.9\&thinsp;\% compared to the current selection. Finally, we go one step further by proposing a robust new selection of 400 IASI channels to further reduce the analysis error for NWP.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Implementation of the GSI system within the atmospheric global circulation model from CPTEC/INPE (AGCM-CPTEC/INPE) is hereafter referred to as the Global 3DVAR (G3DVAR) system. The results of an observing system experiment (OSE) measuring the impacts of radiosonde, satellite radiance, and GPS radio occultation (RO) data on the new G3DVAR system are presented here. The observational impact of each of these platforms was evaluated by measuring the degradation of the geopotential height anomaly correlation and the amplification of the RMSE of the wind. Losing the radiosonde, GPS RO, and satellite radiance data in the OSE resulted in negative impacts on the geopotential height anomaly correlations globally. Nevertheless, the strongest impacts were found over the Southern Hemisphere and South America when satellite radiance data were withheld from the data assimilation system.},

  abstract = {Improving the initial conditions of short-range numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is one of the main goals of the meteorological community. Development of data assimilation and ensemble forecast systems is essential in any national weather service (NWS). In this sense, the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is a methodology that can satisfy both requirements in an efficient manner. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model coupled with the LETKF, developed at the University of Maryland, College Park, have been implemented experimentally at the NWS of Argentina [Servicio Meteorol\'ogico Nacional (SMN)], but at a somewhat lower resolution (40 km) than the operational Global Forecast System (GFS) at that time (27 km). The purpose of this work is not to show that the system presented herein is better than the higher-resolution GFS, but that its performance is reasonably comparable, and to provide the basis for a continued improved development of an independent regional data assimilation and forecasting system. The WRF-LETKF system is tested during the spring of 2012, using the prepared or quality controlled data in Binary Universal Form for Representation of Meteorological Data (PREPBUFR) observations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and lateral boundary conditions from the GFS. To assess the effect of model error, a single-model LETKF system (LETKF-single) is compared with a multischeme implementation (LETKF-multi), which uses different boundary layer and cumulus convection schemes for the generation of the ensemble of forecasts. The performance of both experiments during the test period shows that the LETKF-multi usually outperforms the LETKF-single, evidencing the advantages of the use of the multischeme approach. Both data assimilation systems are slightly worse than the GFS in terms of the synoptic environment representation, as could be expected given their lower resolution. Results from a case study of a strong convective system suggest that the LETKF-multi improves the location of the most intense area of precipitation with respect to the LETKF-single, although both systems show an underestimation of the total accumulated precipitation. These preliminary results encourage continuing the development of an operational data assimilation system based on WRF-LETKF at the SMN.},

  abstract = {A general lightning data assimilation technique is developed and tested with observations from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The technique nudges the water vapor mixing ratio toward saturation within 10 km of a lightning observation and is more general than other approaches that require specific model microphysics or flash rates. This approach is applied to both deterministic and ensemble forecasts of the 29 June 2012 derecho event over the eastern United States and a deterministic forecast of the 17 November 2013 convective event over the Midwest using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model run at a convection-permitting resolution. Lightning data are assimilated over the first three hours of the forecasts, and the subsequent impact on forecast quality is evaluated. For both events, the deterministic simulations with lightning-based nudging produce more realistic predicted composite reflectivity fields. For the forecasts of the 29 June 2012 event using ensemble data assimilation, forecast improvements from lightning assimilation were more modest than for the deterministic forecasts, suggesting that lightning assimilation may produce greater improvements in convective forecasts where conventional observations (e.g., aircraft, surface, radiosonde, satellite) are less dense or unavailable.},

Radial-velocity and reflectivity observations from a single radar were assimilated into a nonhydrostatic, anelastic numerical model initialized with an idealized (horizontally homogeneous) base state. The assimilation results were compared to observations from another Doppler radar, the results of dualDoppler wind syntheses, and in situ measurements from an instrumented tower. Observation errors make it more difficult to assess EnKF performance than in previous storm-scale EnKF experiments that employed synthetic observations and a perfect model; nevertheless, the comparisons in this case indicate that the locations of the main updraft and mesocyclone in the Arcadia storm were determined rather accurately, especially at midlevels. The magnitudes of vertical velocity and vertical vorticity in these features are similar to those in the dual-Doppler analyses, except that the low-level updraft is stronger in the EnKF analyses than in the dual-Doppler analyses.},

These perturbations are random but have been smoothed so that they have correlation length scales of a few kilometers. An ensemble Kalman filter technique is used to assimilate Doppler velocity observations into the cloud model. The supercell and other nearby cells that develop in the model are qualitatively similar to those that were observed. Relative to previous storm-scale ensemble methods, the additive-noise technique reduces the number of spurious cells and their negative consequences during the data assimilation. The additive-noise method is designed to maintain ensemble spread within convective storms during long periods of data assimilation, and it adapts to changing storm configurations. It would be straightforward to use this method in a mesoscale model with explicit convection and inhomogeneous storm environments.},

The present model indicates that, for the pure Holton mechanism (time-independent friction coefficient), the maximum southerly wind speed ymax occurs (depending on the assumed friction coefficient) between sunset and midnight local standard time, which is earlier than the observed after-midnight maximum. For the pure Blackadar mechanism (time-independent thermal forcing), the present model shows that ymax generally occurs later (closer to sunrise) than observed and has a strong latitudinal dependence. For both mechanisms combined, the present model indicates that ymax occurs near to the observed time, which lies between the time obtained in the pure Holton mechanism and the time obtained in the pure Blackadar mechanism; furthermore, ymax is larger (and closer to that observed) than in each one considered individually. The amplitude and phase of the LLJ as a function of latitude can be obtained by the combined model by allowing for the observed latitude-dependent mean and diurnally varying thermal forcing.},

This hybrid system uses the extended control variable method to combine the static and ensemble flow-dependent forecast error covariance. The potential of the hybrid EnSRF-En3DVar system was first explored by comparing the derived results with those obtained using 3DVar and EnSRF approaches alone. Assimilation results showed the hybrid EnSRF-En3DVar system reduces the root mean square innovations for reflectivity and radial velocity, and better represents the pattern of the MCS than either 3DVar or EnSRF. This successful analysis improved quantitative reflectivity and precipitation forecasting skills, and helped forecast the MCS more realistically with regard to location, structure and intensity. Moreover, the root mean square error of the forecast wind, temperature and water vapor mixing ratio were found reduced by the hybrid EnSRF-En3DVar system when compared with the other methods. Diagnoses of the forecast fields showed the hybrid EnSRF-En3DVar system increases low-level cooling and mid-level warming within the convective area. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments testing the ensemble covariance weighting factor effect in the hybrid EnSRF-En3DVar method suggested that a stronger ensemble covariance weighting value led to improved precipitation forecast results.},

This model is valid for nights with weak winds and little cloudiness in rural areas. The model includes an expression of vertical profile of potential temperature within the boundary layer, which is obtained using micrometeorological information from Prairie Grass, Wangara and O'Neill Projects. The expression turned out to be a second-grade polynomial of the dimensionless height of the nocturnal stable boundary layer. The resulting model is a function of the Monin\textendash Obukhov length, the surface potential temperature of air and the roughness length. This model was satisfactorily compared with micrometeorological data. It was applied at three stations of Argentina, using surface hourly meteorological information. From the results that were obtained, the monthly average values of the stable boundary layer thickness were analysed. The maximum monthly average values occur during the cold season and the minimum ones take place during the hot season. It was observed that the monthly average thickness increases with latitude. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A convective parameterization is described and evaluated that may be used in high resolution non-hydrostatic mesoscale models as well as in modeling systems with unstructured varying grid resolutions and for convection aware simulations. This scheme is based on a stochastic approach originally implemented by Grell and Devenyi (2002). Two approaches are tested on resolutions ranging from 20 to 5 km. One approach is based on spreading subsidence to neighboring grid points, the other one on a recently introduced method by Arakawa et al. (2011). Results from model intercomparisons, as well as verification with observations indicate that both the spreading of the subsidence and Arakawa's approach work well for the highest resolution runs. Because of its simplicity and its capability for an automatic smooth transition as the resolution is increased, Arakawa's approach may be preferred. Additionally, interactions with aerosols have been implemented through a CCN dependent autoconversion of cloud water to rain as well as an aerosol dependent evaporation of cloud drops. Initial tests with this newly implemented aerosol approach show plausible results with a decrease in predicted precipitation in some areas, caused by the changed autoconversion mechanism. This change also causes a significant increase of cloud water and ice detrainment near the cloud tops. Some areas also experience an increase of precipitation, most likely caused by strengthened downdrafts.},

In addition to allowing efficient parallel implementation, this takes advantage of the atmosphere's lower dimensionality in local regions. There are two primary methods for localization. In B localization, the background error covariance matrix elements are reduced by a Schur product so that correlations between grid points that are far apart are removed. In R localization, the observation error covariance matrix is multiplied by a distancedependent function, so that far away observations are considered to have infinite error. Successful numerical weather prediction depends upon well-balanced initial conditions to avoid spurious propagation of inertialgravity waves. Previous studies note that B localization can disrupt the relationship between the height gradient and the wind speed of the analysis increments, resulting in an analysis that can be significantly ageostrophic.},

  abstract = {In this study, an analytical solution of nocturnal low level jets (LLJs) is presented. The present model is an extension of Blackadar, who described the nocturnal LLJ as a result of an inertial oscillation. In the present model, the momentum equation in the daytime atmospheric boundary layer includes a term representing convective mixing in addition to mixing with a constant diffusion coefficient. With the convective mixing, the daytime equilibrium wind velocity becomes vertically more uniform than the Ekman solution. In the nighttime atmospheric boundary layer, the convective mixing is assumed to be absent and the diffusion coefficient, which is assumed to be a constant, is smaller than that in the daytime. Without the convective mixing, the nighttime equilibrium wind velocity is the same as that of the Ekman solution.},

  abstract = {Wind profiles from an operational C-band Doppler radar have been combined with data from a bird tracking radar to assess the wind profile quality during bird migration. The weather radar wind profiles (WRWPs) are retrieved using the well-known volume velocity processing (VVP) technique. The X-band bird radar performed range\textendash height scans perpendicular to the main migration direction and bird densities were deduced by counting and normalizing the observed echoes. It is found that the radial velocity standard deviation (␴r) obtained from the VVP retrieval is a skillful indicator of bird migration. Using a threshold of 2 m sϪ1 on ␴r, more than 93\% of the bird-contaminated wind vectors are rejected while over 70\% of the true wind vectors are accepted correctly. For high bird migration densities the raw weather radar wind vectors have a positive speed bias of 8.6 Ϯ 3.8 m sϪ1, while the quality-controlled wind vectors have a negligible speed bias. From the performance statistics against a limited area numerical weather prediction model, it is concluded that all (significant) bird contamination is removed and that high-quality weather radar wind profiles can be obtained, even during the bird migration season.},

  abstract = {Despite dramatic improvements over the last decades, operational NWP forecasts still occasionally suffer from abrupt drops in their forecast skill. Such forecast skill ``dropouts'' may occur even in a perfect NWP system because of the stochastic nature of NWP but can also result from flaws in the NWP system. Recent studies have shown that dropouts occur due not to a model's deficiencies but to misspecified initial conditions, suggesting that they could be mitigated by improving the quality control (QC) system so that the observationminus-background (O-B) innovations that would degrade a forecast can be detected and rejected. The ensemble forecast sensitivity to observations (EFSO) technique enables for the quantification of how much each observation has improved or degraded the forecast. A recent study has shown that 24-h EFSO can detect detrimental O-B innovations that caused regional forecast skill dropouts and that the forecast can be improved by not assimilating them. Inspired by that success, a new QC method is proposed, termed proactive QC (PQC), that detects detrimental innovations 6 h after the analysis using EFSO and then repeats the analysis and forecast without using them. PQC is implemented and tested on a lower-resolution version of NCEP's operational global NWP system. It is shown that EFSO is insensitive to the choice of verification and lead time (24 or 6 h) and that PQC likely improves the analysis, as attested to by forecast improvements of up to 5 days and beyond. Strategies for reducing the computational costs and further optimizing the observation rejection criteria are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The step-mountain eta model has shown a surprising skill in forecasting severe storms. Much of the credit for this should be given to the Betts and Miller (hereafter referred to as BM) convection scheme and the Mellor-Yamada (hereafter referred to as MY) planetary boundary layer (PBL) formulation. However, the eta model was occasionally producing heavy spurious precipitation over warm water, as well as widely spread light precipitation over oceans. In addition, the convective forcing, particularly the shallow one, could lead to negative entropy changes. As the possible causes of the problems, the convection scheme, the processes at the air-water interface, and the MY level 2 and level 2.5 PBL schemes were reexamined. A major revision of the BM scheme was made, a new marine viscous sublayer scheme was designed, and the MY schemes were retuned. The deep convective regimes are postulated to be characterized by a parameter called ``cloud efficiency.'' The relaxation time is extended for low cloud efficiencies and vice versa. It is also postulated that there is a range of reference equilibrium states. The specific reference state is chosen depending on the cloud efficiency. The treatment of the shallow cloud tops was modified, and the shallow reference humidity profiles are specified requiring that the entropy change be nonnegative. Over the oceans there are two layers: (a) a viscous sublayer with the vertical transports determined by the molecular diffusion, and (b) a layer above it with the vertical transports determined by the turbulence. The viscous sublayer operates in different regimes depending on the roughness Reynolds number. The MY level 2.5 turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is initialized from above in the PBL, so that excessive TKE is dissipated at most places during the PBL spinup. The method for calculating the MY level 2.5 master length scale was rectified. To demonstrate the effects of the new schemes for the deep convection and the viscous sublayer, tests were made using two summer cases: one with heavy spurious precipitation, and another with a successful 36-h forecast of a tropical storm. The new schemes had dramatic positive impacts on the case with the spurious precipitation. The results were also favorable in the tropical storm case. The developments presented here were incorporated into the eta model in 1990. The details of further research will be reported elsewhere. The eta model became operational at the National Meteorological Center, Washington, D.C., in June 1993.},

  abstract = {The impacts of multiscale flow-dependent initial condition (IC) perturbations for storm-scale ensemble forecasts of midlatitude convection are investigated using perfect-model observing system simulation experiments. Several diverse cases are used to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the impacts of different IC perturbations on ensemble forecast skill. Scale dependence of the results is assessed by evaluating 2-h storm-scale reflectivity forecasts separately from hourly accumulated mesoscale precipitation forecasts. Forecasts are initialized with different IC ensembles, including an ensemble of multiscale perturbations produced by a multiscale data assimilation system, mesoscale perturbations produced at a coarser resolution, and filtered multiscale perturbations. Mesoscale precipitation forecasts initialized with the multiscale perturbations are more skillful than the forecasts initialized with the mesoscale perturbations at several lead times. This multiscale advantage is due to greater consistency between the IC perturbations and IC uncertainty. This advantage also affects the short-term, smaller-scale forecasts. Reflectivity forecasts on very small scales and very short lead times are more skillful with the multiscale perturbations as a direct result of the smaller-scale IC perturbation energy. The small-scale IC perturbations also contribute to some improvements to the mesoscale precipitation forecasts after the ;5-h lead time. Altogether, these results suggest that the multiscale IC perturbations provided by ensemble data assimilation on the convection-permitting grid can improve storm-scale ensemble forecasts by improving the sampling of IC uncertainty, compared to downscaling of IC perturbations from a coarser-resolution ensemble.},

Assimilation experiments are performed for four different combinations of satellite, radar, and conventional observations using an ensemble Kalman filter assimilation system. Comparison with the high-resolution ``truth'' simulation indicates that the joint assimilation of satellite and radar observations reduces errors in cloud properties compared to the case in which only conventional observations are assimilated. The satellite observations provide the most impact in the mid- to upper troposphere, whereas the radar data also improve the cloud analysis near the surface and aloft as a result of their greater vertical resolution and larger overall sample size. Errors in the wind field are also significantly reduced when radar radial velocity observations were assimilated. Overall, assimilating both satellite and radar data creates the most accurate model analysis, which indicates that both observation types provide independent and complimentary information and illustrates the potential for these datasets for improving mesoscale model analyses and ensuing forecasts.},

In this study, the authors examine the impact of the observations on 1\textendash 3-h forecasts and provide additional analysis of the relationship between simulated satellite and radar data observations to various water vapor and cloud hydrometeor variables. Correlation statistics showed that the radar and satellite observations are sensitive to different variables. Assimilating 6.95-mm TB primarily improved the atmospheric water vapor and frozen cloud hydrometeor variables such as ice and snow. Radar reflectivity proved more effective in both the lower and midtroposphere with the best results observed for rainwater, graupel, and snow. The impacts of assimilating both datasets decrease rapidly as a function of forecast time. By 1 h, the effects of satellite data become small on forecast cloud hydrometeor values, though it remains useful for atmospheric water vapor. The impacts of radar data last somewhat longer, sometimes up to 3 h, but also display a large decrease in effectiveness by 1 h. Generally, assimilating both satellite and radar data simultaneously generates the best analysis and forecast for most cloud hydrometeor variables.},

This research combines Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 13 (GOES-13) cloud water path (CWP) retrievals with Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) reflectivity and radial velocity to examine the impacts of assimilating each for a severe weather event occurring in Oklahoma on 24 May 2011. Data are assimilated into a 3-km model using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter approach with 36 members over a 2-h assimilation window between 1800 and 2000 UTC. Forecasts are then generated for 90 min at 5-min intervals starting at 1930 and 2000 UTC. Results show that both satellite and radar data are able to initiate convection, but that assimilating both spins up a storm much faster. Assimilating CWP also performs well at suppressing spurious precipitation and cloud cover in the model as well as capturing the anvil characteristics of developed storms. Radar data are most effective at resolving the 3D characteristics of the core convection. Assimilating both satellite and radar data generally resulted in the best model analysis and most skillful forecast for this event.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of assimilating satellite retrievals of cloud water path (CWP) to the microphysics scheme used by a convection-allowing numerical model is explored. All experiments use the Advanced Research core of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW), with observations assimilated using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed ensemble adjustment Kalman filter and a 40-member ensemble. Three-dimensional idealized supercell simulations are generated from a deterministic WRF nature run started from a homogeneous set of initial conditions. Four cloud microphysics schemes are tested: Lin\textendash Farley\textendash Orville (LFO), Thompson (THOMP), Morrison double-moment (MOR), and Milbrandt\textendash Yau (MY).For the idealized experiments, assimilating CWP generates a mature supercell after approximately 1 h for all microphysics schemes. Vertical profiles of ensemble covariances show large differences in the relationship between CWP and various hydrometeor mixing ratios. While the differences in overall CWP are small, the experiments generate very different reflectivity analyses of the simulated storm, with MOR and MY underestimating reflectivity by a large margin. Vertical profiles of hydrometeor mixing ratios from each experiment are generally consistent with scheme design, such that the Thompson scheme characterizes the storm top as mostly snow whereas the Milbrandt\textendash Yau scheme characterizes the storm top as mostly ice. The impacts of these differences on 30-min forecasts show that MOR and MY are unable to maintain convection within the model while THOMP and LFO perform somewhat better, though all fail to capture the divergent movement of the storm split in the nature run.},

Part I describes the NEWS-e design and results from radar reflectivity and radial velocity data assimilation for six severe weather events occurring during 2013 and 2014. Part II describes the impact of assimilating satellite liquid and ice water path (LWP and IWP, respectively) retrievals from the GOES Imager along with the radar observations. Assimilating LWP and IWP observations may improve thermodynamic conditions at the surface over the storm-scale domain through better analysis of cloud coverage in the model compared to radar-only experiments. These improvements sometimes corresponded to an improved analysis of supercell storms leading to better forecasts of low-level vorticity. This positive impact was most evident for events where convection is not ongoing at the beginning of the radar and satellite data assimilation period. For more complex cases containing significant amounts of ongoing convection, only assimilating clear-sky satellite retrievals in place of clear-air reflectivity resulted in spurious regions of light precipitation compared to the radar-only experiments. The analyzed tornadic storms in these experiments are sometimes too weak and quickly diminished in intensity in the forecasts. The lessons learned as part of these experiments should lead to improved iterations of the NEWS-e system, building on the modestly successful results described here.},

The WoFS relies on cloud property retrievals such as cloud water path, which have been proven to increase forecast skill compared to only assimilating radar data and other conventional observations. The impacts of assimilating clear-sky radiances have also been explored and shown to provide useful information on midtropospheric moisture content in the near-storm environment. Assimilation of all-sky radiances adds a layer of complexity and is tested to determine its effectiveness across four events occurring in the spring and summer of 2019. Qualitative and object-based verification of severe weather and the near-storm environment are used to assess the impact of assimilating all-sky radiances compared to the current model configuration. We focus our study through the entire WoFS analysis and forecasting cycle (1900\textendash 0600 UTC, daily) so that the impacts throughout the evolution of convection from initiation to large upscale growth can be assessed. Overall, assimilating satellite data improves forecasts relative to radar-only assimilation experiments. The retrieval method with clear-sky radiances performs best overall, but assimilating all-sky radiances does have very positive impacts in certain conditions. In particular, all-sky radiance assimilation improved convective initiation forecast of severe storms in several instances. This work represents an initial attempt at assimilating all-sky radiances into the WoFS and additional research is ongoing to further improve forecast skill.},

We find that, except for short-range forecasts, the use of localization in the analysis, necessary in ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) when the number of ensemble members is much smaller than the model's degrees of freedom, has a negative impact on the accuracy of the sensitivity. This is because the impact of an observation during the analysis (i.e. the analysis increment associated with the observation) is transported by the flow during the integration, and this is ignored when the ensemble sensitivity uses a fixed localization. To address this problem, we introduce two approaches that could be adapted to evolve the localization during the estimation of forecast sensitivity to the observations. The first one estimates the non-linear evolution of the initial localization but is computationally expensive. The second one moves the localization with a constant estimation of the group velocity. Both methods succeed in improving the ensemble estimations for longer forecasts.},

These new features enhance the potential of the LETKF for convective-scale events. The NHM\textendash LETKF was applied to a local severe rainfall event in Japan during 2012. Comparison of the root-meansquare errors between the model first guess and analysis showed that the system assimilated observations appropriately. Analysis ensemble spreads indicated a significant increase around the time torrential rainfall occurred, implying an increase in the uncertainty of environmental fields. Forecasts initialized with LETKF analyses successfully captured intense rainfalls, suggesting that the system could work effectively for local severe weather events. Investigation of probabilistic forecasts by ensemble forecasting indicated that this could become a reliable data source for decision making in the future. A one-way nested data assimilation scheme was also tested. The results demonstrated that assimilation with a finer-resolution model improved the precipitation forecasting of local severe weather conditions.},

Convective systems with lifetimes exceeding 6 h are triggered in a doubly periodic domain. Perfect-model experiments are used to investigate the limited predictability in precipitation forecasts by comparing analysis schemes that resolve different length scales. Starting from a high-resolution reference scheme with 8-km covariance localization and observations with 2-km resolution on a 5-min cycle, an experimental hierarchy is set up by successively choosing a larger covariance localization radius of 32 km, observations that are horizontally averaged by a factor of 4, a coarser resolution in the calculation of the analysis weights, and a cycling interval of 20 min. After 3 h of assimilation, the high-resolution analysis scheme is clearly superior to the configurations with coarser scales in terms of RMS error and field-oriented measures. The difference is associated with the observation resolution and a larger localization radius required for filter convergence with coarse observations. The high-resolution analysis leads to better forecasts for the first hour, but after 3 hours, the forecast quality of the schemes is indistinguishable. The more rapid error growth in forecasts from the high-resolution analysis appears to be associated with a limited predictability of the small scales, but also with gravity wave noise and spurious convective cells. The latter suggests that the field is in some sense less balanced, or less consistent with the model dynamics, than in the coarser-resolution analysis.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is important to the improvement of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Recently, much progress has been made in the direct assimilation of satellite radiance in NWP. In order to use radiance from the infrared channels of the visible and infrared radiometer (VTRR) on FY-3A, biases between the observed radiances and those simulated from model must be corrected. Using the radiosonde data as the input of rapid radiant transfer model CRTM, the simulation error of infrared channels observation of VIRR is analyzed. Based on the analytic results, a regional VIRR radiance bias correction scheme for FY-3A is developed by taking into account both instrument characteristics and observed bias for different types of ground objects in China. The preliminary test result is encouraging, and the scheme is expected to be used in the operational NWP data assimilation system in China.},

  abstract = {Understanding moisture information ahead of tropical cyclone (TC) convection is very important for predicting TC track, intensity, and precipitation. The advanced Himawari imager onboard the Japanese Himawari-8/-9 satellite can provide high spatial and temporal resolution moisture information. Three-layered precipitable water (LPW) with its three water vapor absorption infrared bands can be assimilated to generate better understanding and prediction of TC evolution. The impacts of LPW assimilation in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with nine combinations of physical parameterization schemes, including three cumulus parameterization (CP) and three microphysics parameterization (MP) schemes on TC prediction, have been comprehensively analyzed using Typhoon Hato as a case study. The results indicate that LPW assimilation reduces the average track error and speed up TC movement by better adjustment of the atmospheric circulation fields via changing the vertical structure of moisture and thermal profile. The track forecasts retain sensitivity to CP schemes after LPW assimilation. Also, LPW assimilation improves TC intensity prediction because the latent heat release process is accurately adjusted. It has been revealed that LPW assimilation can weaken the intensity sensitivity to MP schemes more than to CP schemes. Skill scores were used to evaluate precipitation forecasts after Hato's landfall. The results indicate that heavy precipitation forecasts are more sensitive to the choice of MP schemes. After LPW assimilation, the equitable threat scores among different results become similar and all forecast skills are increased. In addition, group statistic results with different initial time show the same conclusions.},

Upper- and low-level circulation fields were derived for seasonal means and SALLJ composites during the warm and cold seasons. The Bonner criterion 1 was applied for sites in central Bolivia and downstream near northern Paraguay, to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SALLJ. On the circulation characteristics, SALLJ composites during the warm season show the enhanced low-level meridional moisture transport coming from equatorial South America as well as an upper-level wave train emanating from the west Pacific propagating toward South America. The intensification of the warm season SALLJ follows the establishment of an upper-level ridge over southern Brazil and a trough over most of Argentina. The circulation anomalies at upper and lower levels suggest that the intensification of the SALLJ would lead to an intensification of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) later on and to the penetration of cold fronts with an area of enhanced convection ahead at the exit region of the SALLJ.},

Recent studies have suggested that bird migrations routinely contaminate wind profiles obtained at night, while historical studies have suggested insects as the main source of such nocturnal clear-air echoes. This study analyzes two cases of nocturnal clear-air return using data from operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR88D) and X- and W-band research radars. The research radars have sufficient resolution to resolve the echo as point targets in some cases. By examining the radar cross section of the resolved point targets, and by determining the target density, it is found for both cases of nocturnal clear-air echoes that the targets are almost certainly insects. The analysis of the dependence of the echo strength on radar wavelength also supports this conclusion.},

Unlike the original MY model, the MYNN model considers e\textcurrency ects of buoyancy on pressure covariances and e\textcurrency ects of stability on the turbulent length scale, with model constants determined from a LES database. One-dimensional simulations of Day 33 of the Wangara field experiment, which was conducted in a flat area of southeastern Australia in 1967, are made by the MY and MYNN models and the results are compared with horizontal-average statistics obtained from a threedimensional LES. The MYNN model improves several weak points of the MY model such as an insu\textperthousand cient growth of the convective boundary layer, and underestimates of the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulent length scale; it reproduces fairly well the results of the LES including the vertical distributions of the mean and turbulent quantities. The improved performance of the MYNN model relies mainly on the new formulation of the turbulent length scale that realistically increases with decreasing stability, and partly on the parameterization of the pressure covariances and the expression for stability functions for third-order turbulent fluxes.},

Two experiments spanning 11 August\textendash 13 September 2008 were run over a domain featuring the Atlantic basin using a 6-h full cycling analysis and forecast system. Deterministic 72-h forecasts were initialized at 0000 and 1200 UTC for a comparison of forecast impact. The two experiments were configured identically with the exception of the inclusion of the MHS radiances (AMHS) in the second to isolate the impacts of the MHS radiance data. The results were verified against several sources, and statistical significance tests indicate the most notable differences are in the midlevel moisture fields. Both configurations were characterized by high moisture biases when compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim, also known as ERA-I) specific humidity fields, as well as precipitable water vapor from an observationally based product. However, the AMHS experiment has midlevel moisture fields closer to the ERA-I and observation datasets. When reducing the verification domain to focus on the subtropical and easterly wave regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, larger improvements in midlevel moisture at nearly all lead times is seen in the AMHS simulation. Finally, when considering tropical cyclone forecasts, the AMHS configuration shows improvement in intensity forecasts at several lead times as well as improvements at early to intermediate lead times for minimum sea level pressure forecasts.},

To effectively assimilate ASR data from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite, a cloud-dependent quality-control procedure and an observation error model were developed. A single humidity band to be assimilated and thinning distance were determined based on observation error statistics. The operational pre-processing and parameter settings, such as observation errors and an adaptive bias correction for CSR, were incorporated into the LETKF data assimilation system. A comparison of the impacts of assimilating ASRs and CSRs was accomplished using single-cycle and 10-day cycle assimilation experiments. Study results revealed that ASR assimilation provided a higher degree of improvement in the first-guess fit for conventional observations and satellite retrievals with respect to temperature, moisture and wind. Furthermore, ASR assimilation displayed a more stable improvement in the prediction of a severe rainfall event because it has more universal data coverage than CSR. Adaptive bias correction schemes with two different sets of predictors for ASRs were tested and revealed the difficulty in extracting additional information for the assimilation of no-bias corrected ASR due to complicated bias factors. This was in contrast to the CSR assimilation, where bias correction had a positive impact.},

The result quantifies the overall positive impacts of the assimilated observations and the relative importance of the satellite radiance observations compared to other types of observations, especially for the moisture fields. A simple moving localisation based on the average wind, although not optimal, seems to work well. The method is also used to identify the cause of local forecast failure cases in the 24-hour forecasts.

The forecast accuracy for each model configuration was evaluated through comparison of observed and simulated Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-13 (GOES-13) infrared brightness temperatures and satellite-derived tropical cyclone intensity estimates computed using the advanced Dvorak technique (ADT). Overall, the analysis revealed a large moist bias in the mid- and upper troposphere during the entire forecast period that was at least partially due to a moist bias in the initialization datasets but was also affected by the microphysics and cumulus parameterization schemes. Large differences occurred in the azimuthal brightness temperature distributions, with two of the microphysics schemes producing hurricane eyes that were much larger and clearer than observed, especially for later forecast hours. Comparisons to the forecast 10-m wind speeds showed reasonable agreement (correlations between 0.58 and 0.74) between the surface-based intensities and the ADT intensity estimates inferred via cloud patterns in the upper troposphere. It was also found that model configurations that had the smallest differences between the ADT and surface-based intensities had the most accurate track and intensity forecasts.

  abstract = {The modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer during convective conditions has long been a major source of uncertainty in the numerical modeling of meteorological conditions and air quality. Much of the difficulty stems from the large range of turbulent scales that are effective in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Both small-scale turbulence that is subgrid in most mesoscale grid models and large-scale turbulence extending to the depth of the CBL are important for the vertical transport of atmospheric properties and chemical species. Eddy diffusion schemes assume that all of the turbulence is subgrid and therefore cannot realistically simulate convective conditions. Simple nonlocal closure PBL models, such as the Blackadar convective model that has been a mainstay PBL option in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University\textendash National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) for many years and the original asymmetric convective model (ACM), also an option in MM5, represent large-scale transport driven by convective plumes but neglect small-scale, subgrid turbulent mixing. A new version of the ACM (ACM2) has been developed that includes the nonlocal scheme of the original ACM combined with an eddy diffusion scheme. Thus, the ACM2 is able to represent both the supergrid- and subgrid-scale components of turbulent transport in the convective boundary layer. Testing the ACM2 in one-dimensional form and comparing it with large-eddy simulations and field data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere\textendash Surface Exchange Study demonstrates that the new scheme accurately simulates PBL heights, profiles of fluxes and mean quantities, and surface-level values. The ACM2 performs equally well for both meteorological parameters (e.g., potential temperature, moisture variables, and winds) and trace chemical concentrations, which is an advantage over eddy diffusion models that include a nonlocal term in the form of a gradient adjustment.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of temperature and moisture profiles from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the prediction of the Indian summer monsoon, using the variational data assimilation system annexed to the Weather Research and Forecasting model. In this study, three numerical experiments are carried out. The first is the control and includes no assimilation; in the second, named Conv, assimilation of conventional Global Telecommunication System data is performed. The third one, named ConvAIRS, is identical to the Conv except that it also includes assimilation of AIRS profiles. The initial fields of tropospheric temperature and water vapor mixing ratio showed significant improvement over the model domain. Assimilation of AIRS profiles has significant impact on predicting the seasonal mean monsoon characteristics such as tropospheric temperature, low-level moisture distribution, easterly wind shear, and precipitation. The vertical structure of the root-mean-square error is substantially affected by the assimilation of AIRS profiles, with smaller errors in temperature, humidity, and wind magnitude. The consequent improved representation of moisture convergence in the boundary layer (deep convection as well) causes an increase in precipitation forecast skill. The fact that the monsoonal circulation is better captured, thanks to an improved representation of thermal gradients, which in turn leads to more realistic moisture transport, is particularly noteworthy. Several previous data impact studies with AIRS and other sensors have focused on the short or medium range of the forecast. The demonstrated improvement in all the predicted fields associated with the Indian summer monsoon, consequent to the month long assimilation of AIRS profiles, is an innovative finding with large implications to the operational seasonal forecasting capabilities over the Indian subcontinent.},

  abstract = {Convective-scale ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are often initialized with downscaled initial condition perturbations (ICPs) from a global coarser EPS. Although downscaled ICPs have been shown to have a positive impact at short ranges, they cannot represent the uncertainty at small scales. Hence, there is a spin-up of around 9\textendash 12 h until the forecast perturbations develop realistic small-scale structures. On the other hand, ensemble data assimilation (EDA) is a common approach to obtain initial perturbations at all scales resolved by the numerical model. However, the high computational cost of EDA systems severely limits their size and their resolution. An alternative cheaper method to derive small-scale ICPs is considered here, based on a random sampling of the model background-error covariances. This article provides an evaluation of random and EDA-based IC perturbation methods against the baseline downscaling approach, in the framework of the pre-operational convective-scale EPS developed at M\'et\'eo-France with the AROME-France model at a 2.5 km horizontal resolution. Small-scale IC perturbation methods are shown to significantly improve the short-range EPS performance for surface weather variables. For 2 m temperature and 10 m wind speed, random ICPs give as good results as the EDA, owing to the very short spin-up of random perturbations. Precipitation forecasts are also strongly improved during the first six forecast hours, especially when initial humidity perturbations are included. The sensitivity of the EPS performance to the EDA size, horizontal resolution and representation of model errors is discussed. It is found that a large fraction of the initial uncertainty can be properly described with an EDA of reasonable size and at a slightly coarser resolution than the EPS.},

Using insects as the radar target, it is possible to provide wind observations during convective development. This study aims to explore the potential of these new observations, with three case studies. Radial winds from insects detected by four operational weather radars were assimilated using threedimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) into a 1.5-km resolution version of the Met Office Unified Model, using a southern U.K. domain and no convective parameterization. The effect on the analyzed wind was small, with changes in direction and speed up to 458 and 2 m s21, respectively. The forecast precipitation was perturbed in space and time but not substantially modified. Radial wind observations from insects show the potential to provide small corrections to the location and timing of showers, but not to completely relocate convergence lines. Overall, quantitative analysis indicated the observation impact in the three case studies was small and neutral. However, the small sample size and possible ground clutter contamination issues preclude unequivocal impact estimation. The study shows the potential positive impact of insect winds; future operational systems using dual-polarization radars that are better able to discriminate between insects and clutter returns should provide a much greater impact on forecasts.},

The surface values of potential temperature and specific humidity from the WRF simulation are used as forcing parameters for the LES runs.

A methodology is developed to derive the components of the geostrophic wind profile that is used in LES to model the largescale horizontal mean pressure gradient and treated as an external forcing. This methodology involves the meteorological model WRF. In this context, the WRF model has a dual task: (1) providing realistic atmospheric environmental forcings to LES and (2) providing a very large dataset to investigate possible improvements of the LES setting to make the numerical prediction more realistic.},

  abstract = {Prior studies have shown that the low-level jet is a recurrent characteristic of the environment during the initiation and mature stages of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over the Great Plains of the United States. The South American low-level jet (SALLJ) over southeastern South America (SESA) has an analogous role, advecting heat and moisture from the Amazon basin southward into the central plains of southeastern South America, generating ideal environmental conditions for convection initiation and growth into MCSs. This research has two purposes. One is to describe the characteristics of a 3-yr MCS sample in South America, south of the equator, and its related geographical distribution of convection frequency. The other is to advance the knowledge of the evolution of favorable environmental conditions for the development of large MCSs, specifically those that mature under SALLJ conditions. High horizontal and temporal resolution satellite images are used to detect MCSs in the area for the period 1 September 2000\textendash 31 May 2003. Operational 1\textdegree{} horizontal resolution fields from NCEP are used to examine the environment associated with the systems and for the same period. Differences between tropical and subtropical MCSs in terms of size, diurnal cycle, and duration are found. Tropical MCSs are smaller, shorter in duration, and are characterized by a diurnal cycle mainly controlled by diurnal radiative heating. Subtropical MCSs show a preference for a nocturnal phase at maturity over Argentina, which contrasts with a tendency for a daytime peak over Uruguay and southern Brazil. In all seasons, at least one subtropical MCS developed in 41\% of the SALLJ days, whereas in the days with no SALLJ conditions this percentage dropped to 12\%. This result shows the importance of the synoptic conditions provided by the SALLJ for the development of MCSs and motivates the study of the atmospheric large-scale structure that evolves in close coexistence between SALLJ and subtropical organized convection at the mature stage. The large-scale environment associated with large long-lived MCSs during SALLJ events over SESA evolves under thermodynamic and dynamic forcings that are well captured by the compositing analysis. Essential features are low-level convergence generated by an anomalous all-day-long strong low-level jet prior to the development of the system, overlapped by high-level divergence associated with the anticyclonic flank of the entrance of an upper-level jet streak. This provides the dynamical forcing for convection initiation in an increasingly convectively unstable atmosphere driven by an intense and persistent horizontal advection of heat and moisture at low levels. These processes act during at least one diurnal cycle, enabling gradual building of optimal conditions for the formation of the largest organized convection in the subtropical area. The frequency of convection culminates in a geographically concentrated nocturnal maximum over northeast Argentina on the following day (MCS\textendash SALLJ day). The northeastward displacement and later dissipation of subtropical convection are affected by a northward advance of a baroclinic zone, which is related to horizontal cold advection and divergence of moisture flux at low levels, both contributing to the stabilization of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Two sets of global, 132-h (5.5-day), 10-member ensemble forecasts were produced with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) for 35 cases in April and May 2017. One MPAS ensemble had a quasiuniform 15-km mesh while the other employed a variable-resolution mesh with 3-km cell spacing over the conterminous United States (CONUS) that smoothly relaxed to 15 km over the rest of the globe. Precipitation forecasts from both MPAS ensembles were objectively verified over the central and eastern CONUS to assess the potential benefits of configuring MPAS with a 3-km mesh refinement region for medium-range forecasts. In addition, forecasts from NCEP's operational Global Ensemble Forecast System were evaluated and served as a baseline against which to compare the experimental MPAS ensembles. The 3-km MPAS ensemble most faithfully reproduced the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation throughout the 132-h forecasts and had superior precipitation skill and reliability over the first 48 h. However, after 48 h, the three ensembles had more similar spread, reliability, and skill, and differences between probabilistic precipitation forecasts derived from the 3- and 15-km MPAS ensembles were typically statistically insignificant. Nonetheless, despite fewer benefits of increased resolution for spatial placement after 48 h, 3-km ensemble members explicitly provided potentially valuable guidance regarding convective mode throughout the 132-h forecasts while the other ensembles did not. Collectively, these results suggest both strengths and limitations of medium-range high-resolution ensemble forecasts and reveal pathways for future investigations to improve understanding of high-resolution global ensembles with variable-resolution meshes.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the ill-conditioned coefficient matrix (CM) and the size of the analysis volume on the retrieval accuracy in the volume velocity processing (VVP) method are analyzed. By estimating the upper limit of the retrieval error and analyzing the effects of neglected parameters on retrieval accuracy, the simplified wind model is found to decrease the difficulty in solving and stabilizing the retrieval results, even though model errors would be induced by neglecting partial parameters. Strong linear correlation among CM vectors would cause an ill-conditioned matrix when more parameters are selected. By using exact coordinate data and changing the size of the analysis volume, the variation of the condition number indicates that a large volume size decreases the condition number, and the decrease caused by increasing the number of volume gates is larger than that caused by increasing the sector width. Using the spread of errors in the solution, a demonstration using mathematical deduction is provided to explain how a large analysis volume can improve retrieval accuracy. A test with a uniform wind field is used to demonstrate these conclusions.},

The WRF model and its three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation system is used to assimilate AIRS measurements (radiances and retrievals) and the impacts of these measurements are evaluated on the analysis and 24-h forecasts over the Indian region for the entire month of July 2010. A rigorous validation is produced against HIRS and Kalpana VHRR radiances, NCEP analysis, and TRMM observed precipitation. Results show that the assimilation of AIRS measurements has a significant impact on WRF analysis and short range forecasts. The radiances simulated using WRF analyzed and forecast fields, assimilated with AIRS measurements, match significantly closer to HIRS and Kalpana VHRR radiances, relative to simulations without AIRS measurements (the control run). Assimilation of AIRS measurements leads to improvement of moisture, temperature, winds and rainfall forecast with respect to control run. This study indicates that assimilation of radiances and bias-adjusted retrievals perform equally well when NCEP analysis is used for the verification, and it is found that analysis and forecasts resulting from assimilated AIRS radiances and bias-adjusted retrievals are of better quality compared to those obtained by assimilating retrievals without bias-adjustment.},

  abstract = {On 24 May 2011, Oklahoma experienced an outbreak of tornadoes, including one rated EF5 on the enhanced Fujita (EF) scale and two rated EF4. The extensive observation network in this area makes this an ideal case to examine the impact of using five different microphysics parameterization schemes, including single-, double-, and triple-moment microphysics, in an efficient high-resolution data assimilation system suitable for nowcasting and short-term forecasting with low latencies. Additionally, the real-time configuration of the 1-km ARPS, which assimilated increments produced by 3DVAR with cloud analysis using incremental analysis updating (IAU), had success providing a good baseline forecast. ARPS forecasts of 0\textendash 2 h are verified using observation-point, neighborhood, and object-based verification techniques. The object-based verification technique uses updraft helicity fields to represent mesocyclone centers, which are verified against tornado locations from three supercells of interest. Varying levels of success in the forecasts are found and appear to be dependent on the complexity of the storm interaction, with early forecasts of isolated storms exhibiting the most success. Verification scores indicate that the multimoment microphysics schemes tend to produce better forecasts of tornadic supercells. However, some of the forecasts from the single-moment microphysics schemes perform as well as or better than the forecasts from the multimoment microphysics schemes.},

  abstract = {A Doppler radar data assimilation system is developed based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method and tested with simulated radar data from a supercell storm. As a first implementation, it is assumed that the forward models are perfect and that the radar data are sampled at the analysis grid points. A general purpose nonhydrostatic compressible model is used with the inclusion of complex multiclass ice microphysics. New aspects of this study compared to previous work include the demonstration of the ability of the EnKF method to retrieve multiple microphysical species associated with a multiclass ice microphysics scheme, and to accurately retrieve the wind and thermodynamic variables. Also new are the inclusion of reflectivity observations and the determination of the relative role of the radial velocity and reflectivity data as well as their spatial coverage in recovering the full-flow and cloud fields. In general, the system is able to reestablish the model storm extremely well after a number of assimilation cycles, and best results are obtained when both radial velocity and reflectivity data, including reflectivity information outside of the precipitation regions, are used. Significant positive impact of the reflectivity assimilation is found even though the observation operator involved is nonlinear. The results also show that a compressible model that contains acoustic modes, hence the associated error growth, performs at least as well as an anelastic model used in previous EnKF studies at the cloud scale.},

By using this perspective, continuous time-dependent wind profiles are predicted. As such, information on both the height and the magnitude of the nocturnal low-level jet is available as a function of time.

These encouraging results supports the ability of the GLM data to positively contribute to nowcasting and forecasting of convective-scale systems, especially over the vast regions of the South American continent currently suffering from limited and, even, an utter lack of observations.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the status of radiative transfer models for satellite data assimilation. The radiative transfer model for satellite data assimilation also known as the satellite radiance operator is one of the most complex and the most computationally expensive operators in the overall cost of assimilation. Therefore weather forecast centres require fast radiative transfer models to assimilate the huge amount of observations from various satellites and sustainable for operational purposes. The assimilation of satellite radiance is currently operated in all-sky conditions in the microwave and in clear-sky and overcast cloudy conditions in the infrared. To make this possible, these radiative transfer models are based on fast atmospheric transmittance models as well as on cloud scattering approximation. The modelization, the validation and the future developments of the two main radiative transfer models RTTOV and CRTM are described here.},

The cloud state is defined as 3D spatially distributed hydrometeors characterized with microphysical properties: mixing ratio, number concentration, and size distribution. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-9 (GOES-9) imager visible and infrared measurements were used in a new four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) mesoscale algorithm for a warm continental stratus cloud system case to test the impact of these observations on the cloud simulation. The new data assimilation algorithm includes the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) with explicit cloud state prediction, the associated adjoint system, and an observational operator for forward and adjoint integrations of the GOES radiances. The results show positive impact of GOES imager measurements on the 3D cloud short-term simulation during and after the assimilation. The impact was achieved through sensitivity of the radiances to the cloud droplet mixing ratio at observation time and a 4D correlation between the cloud and atmospheric thermal and dynamical environment in the forecast model. The dynamical response to the radiance observations was through enhanced large mesoscale vertical mixing while horizontal advection was weak in the case of stable continental stratus evolution.},

  abstract = {A GSI-based EnVar data assimilation system is extended to directly assimilate radar reflectivity to initialize convective-scale forecasts. When hydrometeor mixing ratios are used as state variables (method mixing ratio), large differences of the cost function gradients with respect to the small hydrometeor mixing ratios and wind prevent efficient convergence. Using logarithmic mixing ratios as state variables (method logarithm) fixes this problem, but generates spuriously large hydrometeor increments partly due to the transform to and from the logarithmic space. The tangent linear of the reflectivity operators further contributes to spuriously small and large hydrometeor increments in method mixing ratio and method logarithm, respectively. A new method is proposed by directly adding the reflectivity as a state variable (method dBZ). Without the tangent linear and adjoint of the nonlinear operator, the new method therefore avoids the aforementioned problems. The newly proposed method is examined on the analysis and prediction of the 8 May 2003 Oklahoma City tornadic supercell storm. Both the probabilistic forecast of strong low-level vorticity and maintenance of strong updraft and vorticity in method dBZ are more consistent with reality than in method logarithm and method mixing ratio. Detailed diagnostics suggest that a more realistic cold pool due to the better analyzed hydrometeors in method dBZ than in other methods leads to constructive interaction between the surface gust front and the updraft aloft associated with the midlevel mesocyclone. Similar low-level vorticity forecast and maintenance of the storm are produced by the WSM6 and Thompson microphysics schemes in method dBZ. The Thompson scheme matches the reflectivity distribution with the observations better for all lead times, but shows more southeastward track bias compared to the WSM6 scheme.},

RadZIceVar can analyze both rainwater and ice-phase species (snow and graupel) by directly assimilating radar reflectivity observations. The results of three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) DA experiments with a 3 km grid mesh setting of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model showed that RadZIceVar was effective at producing an analysis of reflectivity pattern and intensity similar to the observed data. Two to three outer loops with 50-100 iterations in each loop were needed to obtain a converged 3D analysis of 15 rainwater, snow, and graupel, including the melting layers with mixed-phase hydrometeors. The deficiencies in the analysis using this operator could be caused by the poor quality of the background fields and the use of the static background error covariance, and these issues can be partially resolved by using radar-retrieved hydrometeors in a preprocessing step and tuning the spatial correlation length scales of the background errors. The direct radar reflectivity assimilation using RadZIceVar also improved the short-term (2 h-5 h) precipitation forecasts compared to those of the experiment without DA.},

The usefulness of the forecasts is highly dependent on how frequently the forecast is updated. Therefore, the data latency is critical for assimilation into regional NWP models for it to be able to assimilate more data within the data cut-off window. These low latency data can be obtained through direct broadcast sites and direct receiving systems. Observing system experiments (OSE) were performed to study the impact of data latency on the LSS forecasts. The experiments assimilated all existing observations including conventional data (from the global telecommunication system, GTS) and satellite sounder radiance data (AMSU-A (The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A), ATMS (Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder), CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder), and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer)). They were carried out in a nested domain with a horizontal resolution of 9 km and 3 km in the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The forecast quality scores of the LSS precipitation forecasts were calculated and compared with different data cut-off widows to evaluate the impact of data latency. The results showed that low latency can lead to an improved and positive impact on precipitation and other forecasts, which indicates the potential application of LEO direct broadcast (DB) data in a high-resolution regional NWP for LSS forecasts.},

Single-Doppler observations are assimilated into a 36-member, storm-scale ensemble during the developing stage of the MCS with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach encoded in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The storm-scale ensemble is constructed from mesoscale EnKF analyses produced from the assimilation of routinely available observations from land and marine stations, rawinsondes, and aircraft, in an attempt to better represent the complex mesoscale environment for this event. Three EnKF simulations were performed using the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) one- and two-moment and Thompson microphysical schemes. All three experiments produce a linear convective segment at the final analysis time, similar to the observed system at 2300 UTC 4 July 2003. The higher-order schemes\textemdash in particular, the Thompson scheme\textemdash are better able to produce short-range forecasts of both the convective and stratiform components of the observed bowing MCS, and produce the smallest temperature errors when comparing surface observations and dropsonde data to corresponding model data.

Forecast performance by the three microphysics schemes is discussed in context of differences in microphysical composition produced in the stratiform precipitation regions of the rearward expanding MCSs.},

Of particular interest is the ability of these 0\textendash 1-h ensemble forecasts to reproduce the low-level rotational characteristics of supercell thunderstorms, as well as other convective hazards. For the tornado-producing thunderstorms considered in this study, ensemble probabilistic forecasts of low-level rotation generally indicated a rotating thunderstorm approximately 30 min before the time of first observed tornado. Displacement errors (often to the north of tornado-affected areas) associated with vorticity swaths were greatest in those forecasts launched 30\textendash 60 min before the time of first tornado. Similar forecasts were produced for a tornadic mesovortex along the leading edge of a bow echo and, again, highlighted a well-defined vorticity swath as much as 30 min prior to the first tornado.},

The three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system for use with the fifthgeneration Pennsylvania State University\textendash NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) is further developed to enable the assimilation of radial velocity observations. Doppler velocities from the Korean Jindo radar are assimilated into MM5 using the 3DVAR system for a heavy rainfall case that occurred on 10 June 2002. The results show that the assimilation of Doppler velocities has a positive impact on the short-range prediction of heavy rainfall. The dynamic balance between atmospheric wind and thermodynamic fields, based on the Richardson equation, is introduced to the 3DVAR system. Vertical velocity (w) increments are included in the 3DVAR system to enable the assimilation of the vertical velocity component of the Doppler radial velocity observation. The forecast of the hydrometeor variables of cloud water (qc) and rainwater (qr) is used in the 3DVAR background fields. The observation operator for Doppler radial velocity is developed and implemented within the 3DVAR system. A series of experiments, assimilating the Korean Jindo radar data for the 10 June 2002 heavy rainfall case, indicates that the scheme for Doppler velocity assimilation is stable and robust in a cycling mode making use of high-frequency radar data. The 3DVAR with assimilation of Doppler radial velocities is shown to improve the prediction of the rainband movement and intensity change. As a result, an improved skill for the short-range heavy rainfall forecast is obtained. The forecasts of other quantities, for example, winds, are also improved. Continuous assimilation with 3-h update cycles is important in producing an improved heavy rainfall forecast. Assimilation of Doppler radar radial velocities using the 3DVAR background fields from a cycling procedure produces skillful rainfall forecasts when verified against observations.},

The method is built on an alias-robust velocity\textendash azimuth display (AR-VAD) analysis. It upgrades and simplifies the previous three-step dealiasing method in three major aspects. First, the AR-VAD is used with sufficiently stringent threshold conditions in place of the original modified VAD for the preliminary reference check to produce alias-free seed data in the first step. Second, the AR-VAD is more accurate than the traditional VAD for the refined reference check in the original second step, so the original second step becomes unnecessary and is removed. Third, a block-to-point continuity check procedure is developed, in place of the point-to-point continuity check in the original third step, which serves to enhance the use of the available seed data in a properly enlarged block area around each flagged data point that is being checked with multiple threshold conditions to avoid false dealiasing. The new method has been tested extensively with aliased radial velocity data collected under various weather conditions, including hurricane high-wind conditions. The robustness of the new method is exemplified by the results tested with three cases. The limitations of the new method and possible improvements are discussed.},

  abstract = {Simulation of radar beam propagation is an important component of numerous radar applications in meteorology, including height assignment, quality control, and especially the so-called radar forward operator. Although beam propagation in the atmosphere depends on the refractive index and its vertical variation, which themselves depend on the actual state of the atmosphere, the most common method is to apply the 4/3 earth radius model, based on climatological standard conditions. Serious deviations from the climatological value can occur under so-called ducting conditions, where radar beams at low elevations can be trapped or propagate in a waveguide-like fashion, such that this model is unsuitable in this case. To account for the actual atmospheric conditions, sophisticated methods have been developed in literature. However, concerning the practical implementation of these methods, it was determined that the description in the literature is not always complete with respect to possible pitfalls for practical implementations.},

  abstract = {Although most of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations have demonstrated the capability to reproduce many meteorological phenomena in the lowest few kilometers, little attention has been paid to the prediction of the diurnal cycles of surface wind speed (VSFC) in relation to surface temperature (TSFC). In this study, the performance of five widely used PBL parameterizations in reproducing the diurnal cycles of VSFC and TSFC is evaluated using the 3-day mesoscale simulations of summertime weak-gradient flows over the central United States where little organized convection and topographical forcing were present. The time series of areaaveraged VSFC and TSFC, as well as the vertical wind and thermal profiles from the five sensitivity simulations, are compared with hourly surface observations and other available data. The hourly surface observations reveal that the diurnal cycles of VSFC are in phase (but surface wind directions are 5\textendash 6 h out of phase) with those of TSFC. It is shown that both VSFC and TSFC are very sensitive to the PBL parameterizations, given the identical conditions for all of the other model parameters. It is found that all five of the PBL schemes can reproduce the diurnal phases of TSFC (and wind directions), albeit with different amplitudes. However, all of the schemes underestimate the strength of VSFC during the daytime, and most of them overestimate it at night. Moreover, some PBL schemes produce pronounced phase errors in VSFC or substantially weak VSFC all of the time, despite their well-simulated diurnal cycle of TSFC. The results indicate that a perfect simulation of the diurnal TSFC cycle (and the thermal structures above) does not guarantee the reproduction of the diurnal cycles of VSFC. The final outcome would depend on how various physical processes, such as the vertical turbulent exchanges of the mass and momentum under different stability conditions, are parameterized. Because the upper portion of the PBL flow is often nearly opposite in phase to VSFC under weak-gradient conditions, the results have significant implications for the predictability of diurnal precipitation and the studies of air quality, wind energy, and other environmental problems.},

  abstract = {This article presents the first practice of assimilating real-world all-sky GOES-16 ABI infrared brightness temperature (BT) observations using an ensemble-based data assimilation system coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model at a convection-allowing (1 km) horizontal resolution, focusing on the tornadic thunderstorm event across Wyoming and Nebraska on 12 June 2017. It is found that spurious clouds created before observed convection initiation are rapidly removed, and the analysis and forecasts of thunderstorms are significantly improved, when all-sky BT observations are assimilated with the adaptive observation error inflation (AOEI) and adaptive background error inflation (ABEI) techniques. Better forecasts of the timing and location of convection initiation can be achieved after only 30 min of assimilating BT observations; both deterministic and probabilistic WRF forecasts of midlevel mesocyclones and low-level vortices, started from the final analysis with 100 min of BT assimilation, closely coincide with the tornado reports. These improvements result not only from the effective suppression of spurious clouds, but also from the better estimations of hydrometeors owing to the frequent assimilation of all-sky BT observations that yield a more accurate analysis of the storm. Results show that BT observations generally have a greater impact on ice particles than liquid water species, which might provide guidance on how to better constrain modeled clouds using these spaceborne observations.},

  abstract = {A new version of the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS, v11) is tested and compared with the operational version (v10) in a 2-yr parallel run. The breeding-based scheme with ensemble transformation and rescaling (ETR) used in the operational GEFS is replaced by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to generate initial ensemble perturbations. The global medium-range forecast model and the Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis used as the initial conditions are upgraded to the GFS 2015 implementation version. The horizontal resolution of GEFS increases from Eulerian T254 (;52 km) for the first 8 days of the forecast and T190 (;70 km) for the second 8 days to semi-Lagrangian T574 (;34 km) and T382 (;52 km), respectively. The sigma pressure hybrid vertical layers increase from 42 to 64 levels. The verification of geopotential height, temperature, and wind fields at selected levels shows that the new GEFS significantly outperforms the operational GEFS up to days 8\textendash 10 except for an increased warm bias over land in the extratropics. It is also found that the parallel system has better reliability in the short-range probability forecasts of precipitation during warm seasons, but no clear improvement in cold seasons. There is a significant degradation of TC track forecasts at days 6\textendash 7 during the 2012\textendash 14 TC seasons over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific. This degradation is most likely a sampling issue from a low number of TCs during these three TC seasons. The results for an extended verification period (2011\textendash 14) and the recent two hurricane seasons (2015 and 2016) are generally positive. The new GEFS became operational at NCEP on 2 December 2015.},

  abstract = {A regional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) system is established for potential Rapid Refresh (RAP) operational application. The system borrows data processing and observation operators from the gridpoint statistical interpolation (GSI), and precalculates observation priors using the GSI. The ensemble square root Kalman filter (EnSRF) algorithm is used, which updates both the state vector and observation priors. All conventional observations that are used in the operational RAP GSI are assimilated. To minimize computational costs, the EnKF is run at 1/3 of the operational RAP resolution or about 40-km grid spacing, and its performance is compared to the GSI using the same datasets and resolution. Short-range (up to 18 h, the RAP forecast length) forecasts are verified against soundings, surface observations, and precipitation data. Experiments are run with 3-hourly assimilation cycles over a 9-day convectively active retrospective period from spring 2010. The EnKF performance was improved by extensive tuning, including the use of height-dependent covariance localization scales and adaptive covariance inflation. When multiple physics parameterization schemes are employed by the EnKF, forecast errors are further reduced, especially for relative humidity and temperature at the upper levels and for surface variables. The best EnKF configuration produces lower forecast errors than the parallel GSI run. Gilbert skill scores of precipitation forecasts on the 13-km RAP grid initialized from the 3-hourly EnKF analyses are consistently better than those from GSI analyses.},

  abstract = {Radiance bias correction is an important and necessary step in the proper use of satellite observations in a data assimilation system. The original radiance bias-correction scheme used in the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system consists of two components: a variational air-mass dependent component and a scan-angle component. The air-mass component is updated within the GSI, while the scan-angle component is updated outside the GSI. This study examines and enhances several aspects of the radiance bias-correction problem. First, a modified pre-conditioning is applied to the bias-correction coefficients and the analysis variables to speed up convergence of the minimization process. A new procedure for applying the modified pre-conditioning in the GSI is utilized. Second, capabilities for detecting any new/missing/recovering radiance data and initializing the bias correction for new radiance data are implemented. A new scheme is proposed and employed to adjust the background-error variances for the bias-correction coefficients automatically, using an approximation of the analysis-error variances from the previous cycle, and to remove the pre-specified predictor scaling parameters. Finally, the capability to perform bias correction for passive channels within the GSI is developed with a new approach. The two-step bias-correction procedure originally used is replaced with a one-step variational bias-correction scheme within the GSI. Experiment results with the GSI-based hybrid ensemble-variational system show that using the modified pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence rate. Moreover, with the one-step scheme, the anomaly correlation of geopotential height at 500 mb is neutral in the Northern Hemisphere but improved in the Southern Hemisphere. The root-mean-square (RMS) error of wind is comparable to that of the two-step scheme and the biases of the global temperature 24 h and 48 h forecasts fitted to the rawinsonde are reduced.},

  abstract = {The capability of all-sky microwave radiance assimilation in the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis system has been developed at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). This development effort required the adaptation of quality control, observation error assignment, bias correction, and background error covariance to all-sky conditions within the ensemble\textendash variational (EnVar) framework. The assimilation of cloudy radiances from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) microwave radiometer for ocean fields of view (FOVs) is the primary emphasis of this study.In the original operational hybrid 3D EnVar Global Forecast System (GFS), the clear-sky approach for radiance data assimilation is applied. Changes to data thinning and quality control have allowed all-sky satellite radiances to be assimilated in the GSI. Along with the symmetric observation error assignment, additional situation-dependent observation error inflation is employed for all-sky conditions. Moreover, in addition to the current radiance bias correction, a new bias correction strategy has been applied to all-sky radiances. In this work, the static background error variance and the ensemble spread of cloud water are examined, and the levels of cloud variability from the ensemble forecast in single- and dual-resolution configurations are discussed. Overall, the all-sky approach provides more realistic simulated brightness temperatures and cloud water analysis increments, and improves analysis off the west coasts of the continents by reducing a known bias in stratus. An approximate 10\% increase in the use of AMSU-A channels 1\textendash 5 and a 12\% increase for channel 15 are also observed. The all-sky AMSU-A radiance assimilation became operational in the 4D EnVar GFS system upgrade of 12 May 2016.},

  abstract = {A regional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation (DA) and forecast system was recently established based on the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis system. The EnKF DA system was tested with continuous threehourly updated cycles followed by 18-h deterministic forecasts from every three-hourly ensemble mean analysis. Initial tests showed negative to neutral impacts of assimilating satellite radiance data due to the improper bias correction procedure. In this study, two bias correction schemes within the established EnKF DA system are investigated and the impact of assimilating additional polar-orbiting satellite radiance is also investigated. Two group experiments are conducted. The purpose of the first group is to evaluate the bias correction procedure. Two online bias correction methods based on GSI 3DVar and EnKF algorithms are used to assimilate AMSU-A radiance data. Results show that both variational and EnKF-based bias correction procedures effectively reduce the observation and background radiance differences, achieving positive impacts on forecasts. With proper bias correction, we assimilate full radiance observations including AMSU-A, AMSU-B, AIRS, HIRS3/4, and MHS in the second group. The relative percentage improvements (RPIs) for all forecast variables compared to those without radiance data assimilation are mostly positive, with the RPI of upper-air relative humidity being the largest. Additionally, precipitation forecasts on a downscaled 13-km grid from 40-km EnKF analyses are also improved by radiance assimilation for almost all forecast hours.},

  abstract = {Since the launch of the NOAA-15 satellite in 1998, the observations from microwave temperature and humidity sounders have been routinely disseminated to user communities through two separate data streams. In the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data stream, brightness temperatures in 15 channels are available primarily for profiling atmospheric temperature from the Earth's surface to the low stratosphere. In the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) or Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) data stream, the brightness temperatures in five channels are included for sounding water vapour in the low troposphere. Assimilation of microwave radiance data in numerical weather prediction systems has also been carried out with AMSU-A and AMSU-B (MHS) data in two separate data streams. A new approach is to combine AMSU-A and MHS radiances into one data stream for their assimilation. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system and the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecast model are employed for testing the impacts of the combined datasets. It is shown that the spatial collocation between MHS and AMSU-A fields of view in the one data stream experiment allows for an improved quality control of MHS data, especially over the conditions where the liquid-phase clouds are dominant. As a result, a closer fit of analyses to AMSU-A and MHS observations is obtained, especially for AMSU-A surface-sensitive channels. The quantitative precipitation forecast skill is improved over a 10-day period when Hurricane Isaac made landfall.},
