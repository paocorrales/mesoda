## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.pdf`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Derived data used in the analysis. Raw data is available upon request. 
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations

## How to run the project locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can clone the repository to your computer and explore the content. 
To run the code, if the data is present, first run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open
`analysis/paper/paper_ana_20181122.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper_ana_20181122.pdf`, or run
`rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console.
